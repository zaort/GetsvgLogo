# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This Node.js command-line application generates a simple logo as an SVG file based on user input. The application prompts the user to enter text (up to three characters), select a text color, choose a shape (circle, triangle, or square), and pick a color for the shape. After entering all the necessary information, the application generates an SVG file named `logo.svg` that matches the user's criteria.
